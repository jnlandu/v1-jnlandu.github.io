    This course was provided by Prof. <a class="yellow" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5wuvTfoAAAAJ&hl=en">Moustapha Cisse</a>. The course had two parts: Statistical learning Theory  and an introductoion to Deep Learning. In the first, we delved into theoretical aspects of machine learning, namely the statistical learning theory,
     where we discussed of supervised and unsupervised learning. We discussed of the ERM problem, Variance-Bias tradeoff, Overfitting and Underfitting, Linear Regression, Classification, Generalized linear models, and dimensionality reduction techiques such:
     <ul class="h6 text-white">
        <li>Random projections</li>
        <li> Principal Component Anlysis</li>
        <li> Prinicpal Canonical Analysis</li>
     </ul> 
    In the second part, we delved into Neural network, weights initialization, CNN, RCNN, Attention Mechanism and Transformers.<br>
